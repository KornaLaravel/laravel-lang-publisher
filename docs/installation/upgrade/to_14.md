# To 14.x from 13.x

1. Make sure your application supports PHP 8.1 or higher;
2. The minimum supported version of Laravel is 8.0.

5. Bump `laravel-lang/attributes` version to `^2.0` in your `composer.json` file;
6. Bump `laravel-lang/http-statuses` version to `^3.0` in your `composer.json` file;
7. Make sure all other connected language packs support the [`new structure`](https://github.com/Laravel-Lang/translations-template/tree/14.x).
8. The `alignment` key in the config file has been renamed to `inline`.
9. Removed `excludes` and `case` config keys.

## Package Development

1. Run the `composer require laravel-lang/status-generator --dev` console command.
2. Run the `vendor/bin/lang upgrade` console command.
3. Replace `LaravelLang\Publisher\Plugins\BasePlugin` with `LaravelLang\Publisher\Plugins\Plugin`.
4. Compare the structure of your project with the [template](https://github.com/Laravel-Lang/translations-template).
5. Replace `vendor()` method with `$vendor` attribute.
6. Added `$version` attribute. Now you can specify search versions. For example, `^5.0 || ^6.0 || ^7.0`.
