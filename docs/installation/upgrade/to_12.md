# To 12.x from 11.x

1. Bump `laravel-lang/publisher` version to `^12.0` in your `composer.json` file;
2. Install dependency:

      ```bash
      composer require laravel-lang/lang
      ```

   Or update the `composer.json` file:

      ```json
      {
          "require-dev": {
              "laravel-lang/lang": "^10.2",
              "laravel-lang/publisher": "^12.1"
          }
      }
      ```

4. Run the `composer update` console command.
