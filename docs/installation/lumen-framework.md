# Lumen Framework

This package is focused on Laravel development, but it can also be used in Lumen with some workarounds. Because Lumen works a little different, as it is like a barebone version of
Laravel and the main configuration parameters are instead located in `bootstrap/app.php`, some alterations must be made.

You can install Laravel Lang Publisher in `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`, and uncommenting this line that registers the `AppServiceProvider` so it can properly load.

```
// $app->register(App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class);
```

If you are not using that line, that is usually handy to manage gracefully multiple Lumen installations, you will have to add this line of code under
the `Register Service Providers` section of your `bootstrap/app.php`.

```php
if ($app->environment() !== 'production') {
    $app->register(\LaravelLang\Publisher\ServiceProvider::class);
}
```
